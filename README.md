A remake of Notepad but in Python, using Tkinter.

## What can it do?

Dark Mode

## How can I use it?
If you have python 3.5+ installed, you can simply clone the repository and run main.py, it will work right out of the box and doesn't contain any dependedencies. 
In the future there will be an option to download an exe version of it, for useage on computers that don't have python installed.
