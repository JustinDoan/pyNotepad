# pyNotepad
A remake of Notepad but in Python, using Tkinter.

## What can it do?
Currently there isn't much you can do with this besides opening and saving files that you have edited.
The plan is to have all of the features that windows notepad contains in pyNotepad.

## How can I use it?
If you have python 3.5+ installed, you can simply download the main.py file and run it, it will work right out of the box and doesn't contain any dependedencies. 
In the future there will be an option to download an exe version of it, for useage on computers that don't have python installed.
This version of pyNotepad works currently on all platforms, provided they support python.
